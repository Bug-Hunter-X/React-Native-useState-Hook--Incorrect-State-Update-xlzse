This React Native code throws an error because of an incorrect use of the `useState` hook. The initial state is an object, but the update function is trying to modify its property directly, which causes issues.  Here is the buggy code:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [myState, setMyState] = useState({ count: 0 });

  const incrementCount = () => {
    myState.count++; // Incorrect: This doesn't trigger a re-render
    setMyState(myState); //This line doesn't correctly update the state
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{myState.count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
